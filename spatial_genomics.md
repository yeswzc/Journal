Protein expression of 79 markers were variable between cores from same tumor...

  Based on previous paper from Neftel et. al., amplification of EGFR, PDGFRA and CDK4 is associated with cancer cell states. The authors quantified their
  amplification using single cell FISH. PDGFRA showed no significant variations. Authors analyzed the frequency of cells in different tumors. The authors c
  orrelated proteins with the cell fractions, and found Olig2 was correlated with N/O cells (no amplification of either EGFR or CDK4)... The authors analyzed 
  TERT mutation. In 50% cores (?not clear what is a core, seems just a ROI was regarded as a core) TERT were mutant. No correlation was found between hTERT 
  promoter mutation and N/O cell frequency.
  Co-occurence stratified tumors in to EGFR & CDK4 co-occocure high (OR higi) high vs non-co-occure (OR low)tumors. ORhigh and ORlow had distent frequency of 
  cell fractions and hTERT mutation.
####  ORhigh tumors were highly enriched in proteins associated with immune cell infiltration and immunosuppressive microenvironment.
