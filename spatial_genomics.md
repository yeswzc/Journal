  Based on previous paper from Neftel et. al., amplification of EGFR, PDGFRA and CDK4 is associated with cancer cell states. The authors quantified their
amplification using single cell FISH. PDGFRA showed no significant variations. Authors analyzed the frequency of cells in different tumors. The authors correlated proteins with the cell fractions, and found Olig2 was correlated with N/O cells (no amplification of either EGFR or CDK4)... The authors analyzed TERT mutation. In 50% cores (?not clear what is a core, seems just a ROI was regarded as a core) TERT were mutant. No correlation was found between hTERT promoter mutation and N/O cell frequency.
  Co-occurence stratified tumors in to EGFR & CDK4 co-occocure high (OR higi) high vs non-co-occure (OR low)tumors. ORhigh and ORlow had distent frequency of 
cell fractions and hTERT mutation.
#### ORhigh tumors were highly enriched in proteins associated with immune cell infiltration and immunosuppressive microenvironment.

pathological complete response (pCR) ~ cancer completely cured
28 patients pre-treatment, on-treatment and post-treatment (pCR or non-pCR), selected spatially distributed ROIs (cancer enriched/immune enriched). Validated in 29 independennt patients.
individual DSP protein markers, including HER2 and CD45, did not significantly differ between pCR and non-pCR cases before treatment.
##### Cancer signaling and immune changes after short-term therapy.
##### Increased heterogeneity during HER2-targeted therapy.
##### DSP of tumor biopsies reveals features associated with pCR.
##### DSP predicts pCR in an independent validation cohort.
##### On-treatment CD45 IHC measurements are associated with pCR.
